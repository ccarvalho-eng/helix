# Short verdict

Good direction. The refactor moves flow/session logic into OTP processes and a clearer boundary (`Helix.Flows`, `SessionServer`, `FlowSessionManager`). That’s the right move. Big surface-area change — needs focused safety checks: supervision, state persistence, blocking work, visibility (telemetry/logging), and tests.

# Highest-priority issues (fix these first)

1. Supervision and restart semantics
   - Ensure `SessionServer` processes are started under a `DynamicSupervisor` (not a simple `Supervisor` child list). Each session must be independently restartable and isolated.
   - Confirm supervisor strategies: use `:one_for_one` with sensible `max_restarts` and `max_seconds`. Document expected restart behaviour.

2. Registry / naming
   - Use `Registry` with `via_tuple/1` consistently to locate session processes. Avoid global atom names for sessions — atoms leak.
   - If you're using `:global` or name atoms anywhere, kill it.

3. Blocking work inside GenServers
   - Any long-running task must not run inside `handle_call`/`handle_cast` synchronously. Offload to `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink/1` or spawn supervised tasks and `GenServer.reply/2` when needed.
   - Search for `handle_call` code that performs I/O, DB persistence, or heavy computation. Those must be async.

4. Call vs cast decisions & timeouts
   - Audit every `GenServer.call` for potential blocking. Set explicit call timeouts where a call must wait, and default to asynchronous `cast` plus notification when possible.
   - Avoid making channel handlers rely on synchronous calls to session servers that may block Phoenix request processes.

5. State persistence / crash recovery
   - What happens to a session's in-memory flow state on crash or node restart? If you need to persist, wire in a persistence layer (DB, ETS snapshot, or event-sourced store) and document the guarantee (eventual, transactional, lost-on-crash).
   - If ephemeral is expected, make it explicit in docs and remove any implicit expectations that state survives restarts.

# Medium-priority issues (next pass)

1. Input validation & boundary checks
   - `Helix.Flows` as boundary must validate commands rigorously and return consistent error tuples. Avoid letting malformed data reach `SessionServer`.
   - Add types and guard clauses where appropriate.

2. Error handling and telemetry
   - Add structured error logging and telemetry points for session start/stop, errors, and major state transitions. This helps when sessions misbehave in prod.
   - Don’t swallow errors silently in `handle_info` — log and escalate when needed.

3. Tests: coverage and shape
   - Tests exist (see test tree) but expand to simulate supervisor restarts, registry lookups, and race conditions.
   - Add tests that simulate heavy concurrent access: multiple channels trying to modify same flow/session.
   - Add property-style tests for invariants (e.g., no duplicate sessions in registry, no lost messages during restart).

4. Dialyzer / typespecs
   - There was a dialyzer fix commit — keep typespecs complete for public functions. They catch a lot of regressions in OTP systems.

5. API docs / architecture
   - The architecture doc was updated; ensure it documents:
     - Supervision tree diagram (explicitly show DynamicSupervisor + Registry).
     - Failure modes and expected behaviour after crashes.
     - Exactly which functions are public API vs internal.

# Low-priority / niceties

1. Telemetry and metrics hooks (latency, calls/sec).
2. Graceful shutdown: session termination cleanup (unregister from Registry, notify pubsub).
3. Backpressure strategy: if session processing backlog grows, how are messages dropped or throttled?
4. Use `:telemetry.execute/3` at key points rather than ad-hoc logs.
5. Add README section showing how to inspect session state in dev (via `:sys.get_state/1` usage or helper functions).

# Concrete suggestions / sample checklist you can act on now

- Confirm `lib/helix/application.ex` adds a `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry` children. If not, change it.
- In `SessionServer`:
  - Add `@spec` for public functions.
  - Ensure `terminate/2` cleans up resources and notifies pubsub.
  - Replace any `:timer.sleep` or blocking calls in callbacks with `Task.Supervisor`.

- In `FlowSessionManager`:
  - Make the interface purely supervisory/lookup — it should not contain flow business logic. Keep business logic in `SessionServer`.

- Add a `test/helix/flows/session_server_test.exs` case that:
  - starts a session, crashes it (raise in a callback), asserts restart, and asserts state after restart (or that state is lost if ephemeral).

- Add a `stress_test.exs` under `test/support/` you can run locally to simulate 50 concurrent clients modifying flows.
- Add `:telemetry.execute/3` in `SessionServer.handle_*` for `[:helix, :session, :changed]` with metadata `{session_id, event}`.

# What I inspected and why I care

I opened the PR files and commit list to verify scope and touched files (big refactor, docs update, dialyzer fix). The PR touches `lib/helix/application.ex`, `lib/helix/flow_session_manager.ex`, `lib/helix/flows.ex`, `flows/session_server.ex`, and tests — so supervision, registration, boundary and tests are all affected. ([GitHub][1])

# Risks I will not ignore

- **Silent state loss** — users assume flows persist; explicit contract must be documented.
- **Process explosion** — starting many sessions without limits can exhaust memory. Add caps and eviction.
- **Blocking Phoenix processes** — synchronous `call` to session server without timeouts can freeze socket handlers.
- **Unrecoverable race conditions** — registry lookup + start race must use `via_tuple` or `DynamicSupervisor.start_child` with `Registry` to avoid double starts.

# If you want, next step I’ll do (pick one)

— Audit `application.ex` and `SessionServer` code for any blocking calls and propose exact code edits (I can draft patches).
— Or draft minimal `architecture.md` section that states failure semantics and supervisor layout clearly.

Say which and I’ll act. Fast, precise. No sugar.
