Helix is a **visual AI workflow builder** that leverages Elixir's OTP architecture for robust, fault-tolerant workflow design. Unlike traditional workflow tools, Helix provides real-time collaboration through supervised GenServer processes and Phoenix Channels, ensuring your workflow sessions are resilient and automatically managed.

**Why Helix?**
- **Fault-Tolerant**: Built on OTP supervision trees with automatic session cleanup and error recovery
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Live multi-user editing with conflict-free synchronization
- **Production-Ready**: Elixir's battle-tested concurrency model handles thousands of concurrent workflow sessions
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clean drag-and-drop interface with full TypeScript support
