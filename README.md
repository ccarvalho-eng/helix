</div>

Create and collaborate on AI workflow diagrams with real-time editing. Built with Elixir/Phoenix and React.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development**: Currently focused on visual design and planning. Workflows are stored in browser localStorage. PostgreSQL persistence and execution coming in future releases.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccarvalho-eng/helix.git
cd helix
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

Open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and start designing workflows.

**Requirements:** Elixir 1.17+, Erlang/OTP 26+, Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL 14+ (for development)

## What it does

- Drag and drop nodes to create workflow diagrams
- Connect nodes to show how agents interact
- Multiple people can edit the same workflow simultaneously
- Changes sync in real-time via WebSockets
- Sessions are managed by Elixir GenServers
- Export diagrams as PNG images

## Development

```bash
mix test && npm test      # run all tests
mix credo --strict        # code quality
npm run test:e2e          # end-to-end tests
```
