Create and collaborate on AI workflow diagrams with real-time editing. Built with Elixir/Phoenix and React.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development
>
> - Visual design and planning only ‚Äî workflows are not executable yet.
> - Workflows are stored in the browser's localStorage (no sync/backups). Clearing browser data or switching devices will lose unsaved workflows.
> - Server-side persistence and execution are planned for future releases.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccarvalho-eng/helix.git
cd helix
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

Open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and start designing workflows.

**Requirements:** Elixir 1.17+, Erlang/OTP 26+, Node.js 18+, PostgreSQL 14+ (for development)

## What it does

- Drag and drop nodes to create workflow diagrams
- Connect nodes to show how agents interact
- Multiple people can edit the same workflow simultaneously
- Real-time sync via WebSockets
  - Last-write-wins: concurrent edits may overwrite each other
  - No queuing: edits made while disconnected are lost and not replayed on reconnect
  - No state resync: reconnecting clients do not receive missed changes
  - No granular access control: assume all connected users with the link can edit
  - Recommendation: coordinate edits or duplicate flows to avoid unintended overwrites
- Sessions are managed by Elixir GenServers
- Export diagrams as PNG images

## Development

```bash
mix test && npm test      # run all tests
mix credo --strict        # code quality
npm run test:e2e          # end-to-end tests
```
